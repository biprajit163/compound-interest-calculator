# Compound-Interest
The goal of this project is to create a function, in JavaScript, that can calculate the compound interest of an initial investment
and return the final amount after a couple of years of investment.

# Compound-Interest-Formula
A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)
using a pull request to grab the code that has the compound interst function and merge it with my main.js
then copy the file into my local repository, and make some changes to display a more clear answer of the compound
interest gained over a certain period of time.
